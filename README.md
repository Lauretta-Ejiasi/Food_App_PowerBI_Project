# Food_App_PowerBI_Project

This is a project based on an online Food App dataset.

The insight generated are based on;
- Customers' engagements and buying habits
- What percentage of customers prefer web purchases and store purchases
- What gender constitutes the majority of customers (male or female)
- Most frequently bought goods by age group, gender, marital status etc
- Whether a household with children or no children affects monthly income and expenditures.

Insights from this report would help inform businesses in keeping up customer engagement on select goods via online websites or store purchases which is key for business growth, especially if the business would like more engagements via the website or in store purchases. 

This report would also provide actionable business insights on products and demographics of people to channel select products to for potential business growth, customer rentention and revenue generation.
